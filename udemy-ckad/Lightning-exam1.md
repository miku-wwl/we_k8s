Create a Persistent Volume called log-volume. It should make use of a storage class name manual. It should use RWX as the access mode and have a size of 1Gi. The volume should use the hostPath /opt/volume/nginx

Next, create a PVC called log-claim requesting a minimum of 200Mi of storage. This PVC should bind to log-volume.

Mount this in a pod called logger at the location /var/www/nginx. This pod should use the image nginx:alpine.

Solution
Solution manifest file to create a Persistent Volume called log-volume as follows:-

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: log-volume
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /opt/volume/nginx

then create a Persistent Volume Claim called log-claim as follows:-

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: log-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Mi
  storageClassName: manual

Check the bind status of PV and PVC by running the following command:-

root@controlplane:~$ kubectl get pv,pvc

Now, create a new pod called logger with nginx:alpine image as follows:-

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: logger
# pod name
  name: logger
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:alpine
    name: logger
    volumeMounts:
    - name: log
      mountPath: /var/www/nginx
  volumes:
  - name: log
    persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: log-claim

Details

log-volume created with correct parameters?

Q. 2

Task
We have deployed a new pod called secure-pod and a service called secure-service. Incoming or Outgoing connections to this pod are not working.
Troubleshoot why this is happening.

Make sure that incoming connection from the pod webapp-color are successful.

Important: Don't delete any current objects deployed.

Solution
Incoming or outgoing connections are not working because of network policy. In the default namespace, we deployed a default-deny network policy which is interrupting the incoming or outgoing connections.

Now, create a network policy called test-network-policy to allow the connections, as follows:-

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      run: secure-pod
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: webapp-color
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80

then check the connectivity from the webapp-color pod to the secure-pod:-

root@controlplane:~$ kubectl exec -it webapp-color -- sh
/opt # nc -v -z -w 5 secure-service 80

Details

Important: Don't Alter Existing Objects!


Connectivity working?

Q. 3

Task
Create a pod called time-check in the dvl1987 namespace. This pod should run a container called time-check that uses the busybox image.

Create a config map called time-config with the data TIME_FREQ=10 in the same namespace.
The time-check container should run the command: while true; do date; sleep $TIME_FREQ;done and write the result to the location /opt/time/time-check.log.
The path /opt/time on the pod should mount a volume that lasts the lifetime of this pod.
Solution
Create a namespace called dvl1987 by using the below command:-

$ kubectl create namespace dvl1987

Solution manifest file to create a configMap called time-config in the given namespace as follows:-

apiVersion: v1
data:
  TIME_FREQ: "10"
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: time-config
  namespace: dvl1987

Now, create a pod called time-check in the same namespace as follows:-

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: time-check
  name: time-check
  namespace: dvl1987
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:

    - name: TIME_FREQ
      valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: time-config
              key: TIME_FREQ

    - mountPath: /opt/time
      name: log-volume
    command:
    - "/bin/sh"
    - "-c"
    - "while true; do date; sleep $TIME_FREQ;done > /opt/time/time-check.log"

Details

Pod time-check configured correctly?

Q. 4

Task

Next upgrade the deployment to version 1.17.

Finally, once all pods are updated, undo the update and go back to the previous version.

Q. 5

Task
Create a redis deployment with the following parameters:

Name of the deployment should be redis using the redis:alpine image. It should have exactly 1 replica.

The container should request for .2 CPU. It should use the label app=redis.

It should mount exactly 2 volumes.

a. An Empty directory volume called data at path /redis-master-data.

b. A configmap volume called redis-config at path /redis-master.

c. The container should expose the port 6379.

Q. 4

Task
Create a new deployment called nginx-deploy, with one single container called nginx, image nginx:1.16 and 4 replicas.
The deployment should use RollingUpdate strategy with maxSurge=1, and maxUnavailable=2.

Next upgrade the deployment to version 1.17.

Finally, once all pods are updated, undo the update and go back to the previous version.

Solution
Run the following command to create a manifest for deployment nginx-deploy and save it into a file:-

kubectl create deployment nginx-deploy --image=nginx:1.16 --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -oyaml > nginx-deploy.yaml

and add the strategy field under the spec section as follows:-

  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 2

So final manifest file for deployment called nginx-deploy should looks like below:-

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx-deploy
  name: nginx-deploy
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-deploy
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 2
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-deploy
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.16
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: nginx

then run the kubectl apply -f nginx-deploy.yaml to create a deployment resource.

Now, upgrade the deployment's image version using the kubectl set image command:-

kubectl set image deployment nginx-deploy nginx=nginx:1.17

Run the kubectl rollout command to undo the update and go back to the previous version:-

kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deploy

Details

Deployment created correctly?


Was the deployment created with nginx:1.16?


Was it upgraded to 1.17?


Deployment rolled back to 1.16?
